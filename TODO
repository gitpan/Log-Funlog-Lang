- Customizable fun messages. Should it be an option with Funlog->new ? Should it be choosen at make time?
 - For now, it is a separate module. Maybe messages should be in an other separate file.
- Politically correct version (with no code related to fun). Made with a diff? Modulable code compiled? ("make pc ? perl Makefile.PL --pc?")
- maybe code and/or speed improvement ;)
- check if cosmetic if 1 char long
- Improve testing codes
